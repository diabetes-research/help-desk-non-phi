### Purpose of this Help Desk GitHub Repository

The Diabetes Research Hub Help Desk is designed to:
- **Streamline issue management** by leveraging GitHub Issues for tracking.
- **Empower end users** to report problems directly from the DRH application they are using or via the Help Desk GitHub repository.
- **Support Agents** in managing, prioritizing, and resolving issues.
- **Admins** in overseeing the workflow, maintaining system health, and optimizing processes.

### User Roles
- **End Users:** Individuals who encounter issues or need assistance.

## How to Use This Repository

### 1. Reporting Issues

#### a. From the Diabetes Research Hub application User Interface
End users can report issues directly from the application they are using, thanks to an integrated issue-reporting feature. This feature allows users to:
- **Submit Issues Seamlessly:** Without needing to visit the GitHub repository, users can report issues directly from the Diabetes Research Hub application's user interface (UI).
- **Provide Context:** The application will automatically include relevant contextual information, such as the current page or feature being used, when the issue occurred.

#### b. Directly in the GitHub Repository
Alternatively, users can report issues directly in this GitHub repository. To do so:
- Navigate to the "Issues" tab in this repository.
- Click on "New Issue" to create a new report.
- Fill in the issue template, which typically includes:
  - **Title:** A brief summary of the problem.
  - **Description:** Detailed information about the issue, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and any relevant screenshots or logs.
  - **Labels:** Optionally, users or support agents can add labels like `bug`, `feature request`, `question`, etc., to categorize the issue.

### 2. Issue Tracking & Management

Support agents are responsible for managing reported issues through the following actions:

- **Assigning Labels:** Categorize issues with relevant labels to indicate their nature (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`).
- **Using Milestones:** Group related issues under milestones to track progress towards larger goals or version releases.
- **Assigning Issues:** Allocate issues to specific support agents based on their expertise or workload.
- **Commenting:** Engage in ongoing communication with end users to gather more information, provide status updates, and clarify any details necessary for resolution.

### 3. Issue Resolution

Once an issue is diagnosed and a solution is implemented:

- The assigned support agent will **close the issue** by updating its status and adding a resolution comment.
- The resolution comment will typically include a summary of the steps taken to resolve the issue, any relevant documentation, and next steps if applicable.
- If the issue persists, users have the option to **reopen the issue** for further investigation.

### 4. Notifications

To keep everyone informed:

- **End users** will receive notifications when their issue is acknowledged, when additional information is required, and when the issue is resolved.
- **Support agents** will be notified when they are assigned to an issue, when there are updates from the user, and when the issue is closed.

## Workflow & Processes

### 1. New Issue Creation

- Start with [FAQ](https://github.com/diabetes-research/help-desk-public-non-phi/discussions/categories/frequently-asked-questions) section to see if it's been answered
- Start a [Discussion](https://github.com/diabetes-research/help-desk-public-non-phi/discussions) if it's a question unrelated to a specific defect
- Report the issue via the Diabetes Research Hub self-service portal
- If the Hub does not help, start an issue via [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/diabetes-research/help-desk-public-non-phi/discussions/new/choose)

Support agents will then:
- **Review the new issues** and ensure they have all the necessary information.
- **Add relevant labels, milestones,** and **assign** the issue to the appropriate support agent.

### 2. Issue Triage

Issues are triaged based on urgency, impact, and complexity. The triage process includes:
- **Prioritizing issues** according to their severity (e.g., `urgent`, `high priority`, `low priority`).
- **Categorizing issues** into different types (e.g., `bug`, `feature request`, `question`).
- **Assigning the right agent** to handle the issue, ensuring it is addressed by someone with the appropriate expertise.

### 3. Resolution Steps

Support agents will follow these steps to resolve issues:
- **Diagnose the issue** by replicating the problem or analyzing the provided details.
- **Communicate with the user** to gather any additional information if needed.
- **Apply a fix or provide a solution** through code changes, configuration adjustments, or guidance.
- **Close the issue** by updating its status and leaving a detailed resolution comment.
- **Link to relevant documentation** or resources if the solution involves user actions or further reading.
